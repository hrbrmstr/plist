Description: A property list is a representation of a hierarchy of objects that 
    can be stored in the file system, memory, or databases and reconstituted later.
    Property lists give applications a lightweight and portable way to store small
    amounts of data. They are hierarchies of data made from specific types of 
    objectsâ€”they are, in effect, an object graph. Tools are provided to read
    and manipulate binary or XML property lists.
