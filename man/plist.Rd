\title{Read and Manipulate Binary or XML Property Lists}
\description{
A property list is a representation of a hierarchy of objects that
can be stored in the file system, memory, or databases and reconstituted later.
Property lists give applications a lightweight and portable way to store small
amounts of data. They are hierarchies of data made from specific types of
objectsâ€”they are, in effect, an object graph. Tools are provided to read
and manipulate binary or XML property lists.
