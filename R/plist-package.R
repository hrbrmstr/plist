#' Read and Manipulate Binary or XML Property Lists
#'
#' A property list is a representation of a hierarchy of objects that
#' can be stored in the file system, memory, or databases and reconstituted later.
#' Property lists give applications a lightweight and portable way to store small
#' amounts of data. They are hierarchies of data made from specific types of
#' objectsâ€”they are, in effect, an object graph. Tools are provided to read
#' and manipulate binary or XML property lists.
